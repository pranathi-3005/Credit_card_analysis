💳 Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Summary
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of credit card transactions using Power BI. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights into customer behavior, card type usage, transaction volumes, and spending patterns over time.

Through a clean, interactive dashboard, stakeholders can monitor KPIs such as average transaction amount, quarterly spending trends, card type performance, and geographical spending distribution — all of which enable better decision-making and strategy development.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze credit card transactions to identify key trends and patterns.

Segment customers and card types based on usage.

Track transaction activity across quarters and states.

Build a professional-quality dashboard for executive-level reporting.

📊 Key Features

🧠 Insights Extracted
Quarter-wise growth in credit card usage across the year.

Certain card types showed consistently higher transaction values.

Spending was concentrated in a few high-value states.

A drop/spike in transaction activity could be linked to seasonal behavior or campaigns.
